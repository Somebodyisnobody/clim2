Release notes entries for the next release.     -*- mode: text -*-

Instructions:

1. Please provide a short summary below of your user-visible changes
   to the product.
2. Include a bug or rfe id (component should be `documentation') that
   contains the information the documentation group needs to document
   the new feature or change.

Remember, the audience for the summary you write is the customer, not
developers or documentation.

1. rfe3925. CLIM now works in a case-sensitive Lisp.  CLIM now will
   work in two flavours of Lisp: `traditional' ANSI Lisp -- standard
   CL symbols are uppercase, the reader converts non-escaped symbols
   to uppercase; `modern' Lisp -- standard CL symbols are lowercase,
   and the reader does no case conversion.  In the former case, all
   exported CLIM symbols are uppercase as before; in the latter they
   are lowercase.

2. spr21587. On Windows platforms, NOTIFY-USER now always raises the
   dialog box it creates to the top of the window stack.  Formerly it
   could be buried behind other windows if the CLIM application frame
   was itself buried.

3. bug8764.  Lisp will not prompt you to be sure you want to exit Lisp
   if CLIM timers have been used.  Previously if exited Lisp it would
   ask you to confirm that you wanted to do so if you'd ever used a
   timer.

4. <norfe>. For Unix/Linux the CLIM debug fasls (clim-debug.fasl,
   clim-debugwnn.fasl and clim-debuxm.fasl) are empty.  The debugging
   code is now included in the normal fasls and the empty files
   included for backwards compatibility.  In a future release they
   will disappear.
