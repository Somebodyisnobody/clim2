Instructions:

1. Please provide a short summary below of your user-visible changes
   to the product.
2. Include a bug or rfe id (component should be `documentation') that
   contains the information the documentation group needs to document
   the new feature or change.

Remember, the audience for the summary you write is the customer, not
developers or documentation.

1. bug9206, bug9207, bug9208.
   On HP systems, creation of various motif widgets -- such as 
   dialog boxes resulting from calls to accepting-values -- can cause
   errors because fontsets can not be created, with an immediately
   preceding warning that the charset HP-ROMAN8 is missing when trying to 
   create the fontset.  This should happen only when running CLIM in
   an international Lisp, on an HP machine with the X display on a non-HP
   machine.

   The reason for this is that HP's default locales seem to specify that the
   HP-ROMAN8 codeset must be available in X.  For non-HP X servers it 
   typically is not available, and thus this error occurs.

   There are two solutions (apart from displaying on an HP X server):

   A. Run Lisp in a locale which does not require the HP-ROMAN8 codeset.  
   HP provide such several locales which have names like <x>.iso88591.  So, 
   for instance, rather than using the C locale, you should be able to use 
   the C.iso88591 locale.

   You can find out which locale you are in by issuing the `locale' shell 
   command.
   
   You can list all available locales by issuing the `locale -a' command.

   You can set the current locale for Lisp either by setting the LANG
   environment variable before running Lisp:

   Bourne shell:

	LANG=C.iso88591; export LANG; mlisp

   C shell:

	setenv LANG C.iso88591; mlisp


   or by running Lisp with the -locale switch:

	mlisp -locale C.iso88591

   B. Make the hp-roman8-encoded fonts available to the X server.
   This could be done by running a funt server on the HP machine, or by
   physically copying the fonts from the HP machine to the machine with
   the X server.  The details of how to do this are not covered here.
