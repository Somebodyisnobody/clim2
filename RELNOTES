Release notes entries for the next release.     -*- mode: text -*-

Instructions:

1. Please provide a short summary below of your user-visible changes
   to the product.
2. Include a bug or rfe id (component should be `documentation') that
   contains the information the documentation group needs to document
   the new feature or change.

Remember, the audience for the summary you write is the customer, not
developers or documentation.

************* add new entries below this line *********************************

1. rfe3925. CLIM now works in a case-sensitive Lisp.  CLIM now will
   work in two flavours of Lisp: `traditional' ANSI Lisp -- standard
   CL symbols are uppercase, the reader converts non-escaped symbols
   to uppercase; `modern' Lisp -- standard CL symbols are lowercase,
   and the reader does no case conversion.  In the former case, all
   exported CLIM symbols are uppercase as before; in the latter they
   are lowercase.

2. spr21587. On Windows platforms, NOTIFY-USER now always raises the
   dialog box it creates to the top of the window stack.  Formerly it
   could be buried behind other windows if the CLIM application frame
   was itself buried.

3. bug8764.  Lisp will not prompt you to be sure you want to exit Lisp
   if CLIM timers have been used.  Previously if exited Lisp it would
   ask you to confirm that you wanted to do so if you'd ever used a
   timer.

4. <norfe>. For Unix/Linux the CLIM debug fasls (clim-debug.fasl,
   clim-debugwnn.fasl and clim-debuxm.fasl) are empty.  The debugging
   code is now included in the normal fasls and the empty files
   included for backwards compatibility.  In a future release they
   will disappear.

5. <norfe>.  CLIM has been changed so that, the standard frame
   top-level loop defaultly rebinds *error-output* to itself, and not
   to one of the frame panes.  This is an incompatible change, which
   was made to stop problems when Lisp messages (unrelated to the CLIM
   application) were getting printed to CLIM panes.  This is at best
   annoying, and at worst can cause errors in incremental redisplay.

   Rather than hard-wire this change, it is controlled by an argument
   to make-application-frame / make-instance of
   standard-application-frame:

   (make-application-frame ... :non-frame-stream-names <name list>)

   Will cause the default top-level loop to rebind the values of the
   standard streams named in <name list> to themselves, not to CLIM
   panes, even when there are suitable panes available. The default
   case is as if you said:

   (make-application-frame ... :non-frame-stream-names '(*error-output*))

   And you can inhibit the new behaviour by saying:

   (make-application-frame ... :non-frame-stream-names '())

   or providing this as a default-initarg in a frame class definition.

   Note that this behaviour is controlled in terms of stream *names*
   not streams, and in fact it is more general than just
   *error-output*.  The names that make sense in the list are
   *standard-output*, *standard-output*, *error-output*, *query-io*
   and *pointer-documentation-output*.

   The behaviour of the generic functions frame-standard-output,
   frame-standard-input, frame-query-io, frame-error-output and
   frame-pointer-documentation-output are altered by this change.  If
   the corresponding stream will be rebound to its old value in the
   frame, the methods defined on standard-application-frame for these
   generic functions will return nil rather than a stream.
