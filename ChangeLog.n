Thu Aug 12 12:01:08 1993  Kevin Layer  (layer@sole)

	* Makefile.cobjs-svr4: make sure setup_LLP exists before using it.

	* Makefile.defs: add TRAIN_PROFILEP, TMP=/usr/tmp

	* Makefile.generic: new rules (used by make-dist) train-xm and
	train-ol

	* Makefile.sun-sun4: renamed from Makefile.svr4

	* misc/devl-load-1.lisp: load-it now takes a keyword argument:
	load-composer (used by make-dist); fix name of clos preload file
	to be the same as the one make-dist creates (so if the training is
	run, then make-dist will use the `better' one).

	* misc/train.lisp: compile test/test-suite only if needed, and do
	it with :print nil and :vervose t (instead of both t); don't do
	generate-coverate-report unless fboundp.  Remove clos-preload files
	before starting.

	* test/test-driver.lisp: print test report to *error-output* so
	make-dist can segregate it from the rest of the test output

	* tk/pkg.lisp: add in-package (so don't get a compiler warning)

	* tk-silica/pkg.lisp: fix defpackage (use keywords instead of
	symbols in whatever package is current); add in-package

	* xlib/pkg.lisp: add in-package

	* utils/processes.lisp: require :mdproc and :process

*******************************************************************************

from swm: Mon Jul 20 13:49:12 PDT 1992

General bug fixing
  - Small problem in OUTPUT-RECORD-ELEMENT for STANDARD-SEQUENCE-OUTPUT-RECORD 
  - Fixed one problem in incremental redisplay of overlapping output
  - Fixed GENERATE-CROSSING-EVENTS not to generate exit events when moving
    into a child sheet.  Controlled by *GENERATE-EXIT-EVENT-WHEN-ENTERING-CHILD*.
  - Renamed MOVE-SHEET*, RESIZE-SHEET*, and MOVE-AND-RESIZE-SHEET* to remove the
    "*" from the names.
  - Made frames such as menus and dialogs position themselves appropriately. 
  - Made MAKE-APPLICATION-FRAME position the frame to the requested place.
  - Made POINTER-SET-POSITION tell the host to actually move the pointer.
    *** You will need to implement SILICA:PORT-SET-POINTER-POSITION for the
    Motif and OpenLook ports. ***
  - Made the port event loops continually update the modifer state slot in
    the port object, and the buttons state in the pointer object.  This is
    needed so that users can reliably query the state of these objects.
  - Put INVALIDATE-CACHED-REGIONS and INVALIDATE-CACHED-TRANSFORMATIONS methods
    on the proper classes,
  - Fix DEFINE-CLX-KEYSYM, DEFINE-GENERA-KEYSYM, and TK-SILICA::DEFINE-KEYSYM
    to evaluate their keysym arguments.  (Now I know why the keyboard gesture
    stuff was not working for you - it worked by accident on Genera.)
  - Extended the demo driver functions to take a port argument, so that
    the demos can be used simultaneously on multiple ports.  (We needed
    this for AAAI.)

General performance work
  - Added support for resourced events.  This feature is off by default while
    I finish debugging it.  There is a (harmless) storage leak I haven't found
    yet, plus one case where events get multiply deallocated.  Overall, this
    reduces consing tremendously, and has no performance penalty.
  - Implemented MAP-OVER-SHEETS-OVERLAPPING-REGION, which is a non-consing
    version of CHILDREN-OVERLAPPING-REGION.  This gets used all the time.
  - Made RESIZE-SHEET, UPDATE-REGION, and VIEWPORT-REGION-CHANGED, and some 
    other things avoid consing a new region by reusing the old one.
  - Added lots of DYNAMIC-EXTENT declarations to avoid consing excessive lexical
    closure environments.
  - Change SHEET-SINGLE-CHILD-MIXIN so that SHEET-CHILDREN does not cons.
  - Optimized DEFINE-GRAPHICS-GENERIC a little more.
  - Changed MEDIUM-COPY-AREA methods for Genera and CLX port to call 
    SHEET-DEVICE-TRANSFORMATION instead of SHEET-NATIVE-TRANSFORMATION.
    The two functions always return the same result, but SHEET-NATIVE-TRANSFORMATION
    conses each time it is called.
  - Changed CURSOR-SET-POSITION to manage the cursor in a speedier way in some 
    cases (it doesn't notify the host when FASTP is T).  There is still a bug that
    needs to be fixed by changing one place to bind the cursor off.  This makes
    text output about 35-40% faster.
  - Made INVALIDATE-CACHED-REGIONS set a flag to indicate that the region should
    be recomputed.  Then SHEET-DEVICE-REGION reuses the previous invalidated
    region instead of creating a new one.  This save a *lot* of consing during
    scrolling.

The Genera port
  - Fixed problems in DRAW-PATTERN*
  - Fixed some race conditions with Genera's window system
  - Made text output twice as fast.

The CLX port
  - Made configuration and exposure notifications work correctly.
  - Made pixmaps work

CHANGES
	-- Fixed scroll-extent so that copied region is correct, also so that
	   repaint is correctly clipped to newly visible region.

	-- Put in window-width,height,depth readers.

	-- Moved setting of backing store to exposure callback.

	-- Created new gcontext subclass to allow much faster adjust-ink.

	-- Get rid of 'unknown event 4'.

	-- Have draw-rotated-text null out gcontext clip mask cache.

	-- Other minor cleanups & speedups.

	Optimized port-draw-* functions.

	Optimized convert-to-device-* macros.

	Added fast-abs macro to lisp-utilities.  Do abs() assuming all fixnums.

	Lots of other speedups.

	Made object-display slot fixed index (0).
	  Fixed Lisp's slot-value-using-class macro to allow this
	  without having to heavily munge CLIM source.

	Cached clip-mask in medium.  Update it lazily when needed.  Invalidate
	it when necessary.

	Cached clip-mask in medium, and medium in ink.
	  Only send a request to X when necessary.

	Wrote lisp-xdrawstring.

	Added XmMyDrawingArea (for lack of better name).  It compresses
	exposure events.

	Made xid->object mapping be specialized per display.

	Highly optimized set-values, get-values, and resource converters

	Other misc stuff too boring to describe here.

IGNORE JDI SPECIFIC CHANGES TO Makefile

--

	Turn on call counting and declared-fixnums-remain-fixnums when
	compiling Clim.
		-- misc/compile-1

	Repoint scm links.
		-- misc/dec-load-1

	Make clim-small build work.
		-- misc/load-xm

	tk/xtk becomes tk/xt-defs.  Added tk/xm-defs, tk/ol-defs, and tk/ol-funs.
		-- sys/sysdcl

	Renamed foreign functions consistently.  All XT foreign functions
	are named like:
		xt_add_callback
	OL and XM are similiar
		-- lots

	Moved all def-c-types to tk/??-defs files.
		-- lots

	Moved all defforeigns to tk/??-funs files.

	Opencode some foreign functions (those that are used a lot)

	Event loop reworked -- added wait-for-event function so you can
	wait for an event before grabbing the event lock.  Added event
	locking so you can handle events synchronously.
	
	Added code to grab certain matching events from the event queue.
		-- get-event-matching-sequence-and-types

	Added synchronous event handling to copy-area to handle graphics-
	expose events.

	Miscellaneous cleanup of gcontext code.

	Made c-types be created in lisp space, unless they have to be in
	C space.

	Fixed lookup-string, encode-dashes, draw-polygon*, and other places
	that called malloc to not call malloc -- either use resource or
	make-vector.

	Made drawing with simple opacities (of the foreground color) work.

	Made port event handler restartable.

	Integrated Sun's copyright

	Lots of other stuff
